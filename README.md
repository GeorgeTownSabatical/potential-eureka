# QuantumFoam

**QuantumFoam** is a layered, manifold-centric quantum foam signal inference and analysis toolkit.

## Features

- High-throughput, compliance-driven, multi-source signal analytics
- Quantum Foam Inference Metric (QFIM) calculation
- Real-time anomaly detection and streaming analysis
- Device abstraction for high-frequency recording/streaming
- Robust storage and metadata management
- Modular, extensible architecture for advanced research or field deployment

## Quickstart

1. **Install dependencies**  
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib soundfile pyyaml

Always show details


2. **Run an example**  
python examples/example_qfim.py

Always show details


3. **Develop your own modules and models**  
- Start with the stubs in `quantumfoam/`
- Store audio and analysis results in `/storage`
- Log events in `/logs`

## Compliance & Security

- Designed for high-integrity, research-grade or operational use
- All data operations can be routed through `storage/`
- Default settings are provided in `config.py`
- Extend for quantum-safe or FIPS-compliant storage as needed
